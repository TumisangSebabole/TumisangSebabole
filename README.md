#👋 Welcome to my Github Profile
## About Me
My name is Tumisang Trevor Sebabole, a student at Botswana Accountancy College currently studying Bsc(Hons) in Business Intelligence and Data Analytics. I’m passionate about uncovering insights from data and turning numbers into meaningful decisions. My love and passion for numbers has led me the pursuit of geting a career in data analytics before focusing on being a data scientist.

Beyond academics, I’m on an exciting journey to become a professional poker player, where strategic thinking, probability, and pattern recognition are key—skills that also fuel my love for data analysis. My ultimate goal is to merge these two worlds: leveraging analytical skills to excel both in data-driven careers and in the competitive world of poker.

I’m always eager to learn, grow, and challenge myself, whether it’s through crunching datasets, developing strategies, or exploring new opportunities that push me closer to becoming the best version of myself.
